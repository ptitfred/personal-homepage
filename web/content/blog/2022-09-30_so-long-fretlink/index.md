3 months ago was my last day at [Fretlink](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fretlink/).

Actually it was the last day for all of us as the company went down following the infamous [Liquidation Judiciaire](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation_judiciaire_en_droit_fran%C3%A7ais).

It's been almost 6 years of hard work to try modernizing the freight forwarding industry. We made some progress but it is a rough industry and we didn't pull that one off, I'm afraid.

Others like sennder continue. Let's see how it goes.

I've met, hired, worked with many great people, and I can't list them here. I can only say that a dozen of very talented and qualified developers are available like I am. Feel free to [ping me](mailto:contact@frederic.menou.me) if you want an introduction to one of them (but please don't fish the list).

Speaking of looking for a job, I am also in this position as you might have figured out. I've updated my resume accordingly, available [in a printable web version](/resume.html).

I've been in various positions but lately I'm mostly known for being a CTO.
I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for yet, but let's say I'm more interested in early stage projects with the opportunity of building a team and creating a product culture in the company I would join.

I'm grateful in advance to anybody sharing this post. I'm sure I'll find something interesting!

Cheers,

Frédéric
